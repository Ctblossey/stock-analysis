# Refactoring VBA Code

## Overview of Project

### The purpose of [this project](https://github.com/Ctblossey/stock-analysis) is to take a deep dive into the stock market and bringing the raw data to life. Within the [data](https://github.com/Ctblossey/stock-analysis/blob/main/VBA_Challenge.xlsm) you can see that there is a lot of good data but not a lot of explaining. Through the work of the VBA code, we were able to refactor the code to efficiently display each of the tickers along with their volume and return. It is very important to explain the data and show its impact.

## Results

### Analysis of 2017

- ### There was a lot of good data coming from 2017. However, it was hard to interpret what any of it meant without an analysis. The "All Stocks Analysis" sheet provided good insights into how the year 2017 actually went for the tickers. 2017 was a very positive year, with eleven out of the twelve tickers being in the green, with the highest (DQ) having a nearly 200% return.

### Analysis of 2018

- ### Similar to the 2017 data, the "All Stocks Analysis" sheet allowed the 2018 data to be interpreted. Unlike 2017, 2018 did not have a good year when it came to returns. Only two tickers remained in the green, while the other ten were in the red. Comparing the year to year, there were two tickers that remained green in both years: ENPH and RUN; while there was one that was red both years: TERP.
