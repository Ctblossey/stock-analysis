# Refactoring VBA Code

## Overview of Project

### The purpose of [this project](https://github.com/Ctblossey/stock-analysis) is to take a deep dive into the stock market and bringing the raw data to life. Within the [data](https://github.com/Ctblossey/stock-analysis/blob/main/VBA_Challenge.xlsm) you can see that there is a lot of good data but not a lot of explaining. Through the work of the VBA code, we were able to refactor the code to efficiently display each of the tickers along with their volume and return. It is very important to explain the data and show its impact.

## Results

### Analysis of 2017

- ### There was a lot of good data coming from 2017. However, it was hard to interpret what any of it meant without an analysis. The "All Stocks Analysis" sheet provided good insights into how the year 2017 actually went for the tickers. 2017 was a very positive year, with eleven out of the twelve tickers being in the green, with the highest (DQ) having a nearly 200% return.

### Analysis of 2018

- ### Similar to the 2017 data, the "All Stocks Analysis" sheet allowed the 2018 data to be interpreted. Unlike 2017, 2018 did not have a good year when it came to returns. Only two tickers remained in the green, while the other ten were in the red. Comparing the year to year, there were two tickers that remained green in both years: ENPH and RUN; while there was one that was red both years: TERP.

## Summary

- ### There are many advantages and disadvantages in regard to refactoring code. The main advantages are cleanliness and efficiency, partly going hand in hand. Once you know your code works, it is important to go back and figure out where you took the long route when there is actually a better way to do it. Not only does this improve cleanliness, it improves efficiency when the code is ran. The main disadvantage of refactoring is trying to make your code too efficient. During the process, it is easy to change your code into something much shorter, when in reality you've just broken the code and made a mess. There's also a possibility that you've gotten rid of the correct code in hopes for a better one. 
- ### Looking at the VBA script, there are advantages and disadvantages to what we did. Overall, the advantages outweigh the disadvantages, but the challenges should not be overlooked. Throughout refactoring, it is a difficult process trying to figure out where you could improve, where errors may be, or even using wrong code during the process. Refactoring is a difficult process and may cause more harm. However, the refactoring done to the VBA script was overall beneficial. Since the code was not too elaborate, we were able to easily pinpoint where efficiencies could be made and made the change. Even though it took time to figure out the "best" way, the refactored code was not only cleaner but more efficient.
